## Where did the other parts of Carbonite go? Where is my Warehouse or Social Tracker? ##

One of the biggest complaints about **Carbonite**, both from a developer perspective and from a users has been that it was too large and tried to do too much. Now with this release, **Carbonite** itself is just the maps and nothing more. Each thing **Carbonite** did, can be picked and chosen as you wish by installing it separately. You can use as much or as little as you want.
